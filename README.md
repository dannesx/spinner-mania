## About this project ðŸ“‹

Spinner Mania is a hyper casual mobile game made in Unity developed by [me](https://github.com/dannesx) for Android devices. This is a simple game: you just need to spin the fidget spinner scrolling the screen, then you will earn so much money to spend it in upgrades and skins.
